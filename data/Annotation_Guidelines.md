# Guidelines: 

---
## Part I:
- We will label each sentence in a news article based on how relevant it is for describing the main story. 
- The first category Main story (M) covers sentences that describe the main story, including main events and their real consequences.
- The second category Context-informing contents (C) covers sentences that directly explain the context of the main story
- The third category Distantly-related contents (D) covers sentences that provide further supporting context for the main story 
- Lastly, we also have a category for not applicable sentences (N).

### Main story (M):
#### Main Event: 
- Sentences describing main event that directly relates to the major subject of an article. Main event is the most recent event (trigger event) that gave rise to a news report. Generally, main event should have happened already. However, main event can be a projected event since some news articles focus on events that are to happen soon.
- Statements rephrasing the main event made by entities that are directly related to the main event.

#### Consequences:
- Sentences describing the real consequences of main events that often happen right after main events and are due to main events.

### Context-informing content (C):
#### Previous Event: 
- Sentences describing previous events that are specific, have occurred recently and inform the cause of main events. Note that sentences describing events that acted as the pre-condition for main event also belong to this category.
#### Current Context: 
- Sentences describing any general circumstances that inform the cause of main events.
- Sentences describing actual situation in which the main event took place. They should have temporal co-occurrence with the main event or talk about the ongoing situation. 

### Distantly-related content (D):
#### Historical Event: 
- Sentences describing previous events that have not occurred recently, at least 2 months prior to the main event.
- Sentences describing events that occurred in previous years with no specification of time elapsed.
#### Anecdotal Event: 
- Sentences describing events that are anecdotal, such events may happen before or after main events. Anecdotal events are specific events with specific participants that are uncertain (may happen in future) or can't be verified (happened in past).
- In case of Speech, if the statement was made in a private discussion (verbal or written) and is unverifiable.
#### Evaluation: 
- Sentences that are explicitly an opinion and comment on any events in the story.  
#### Expectations: 
- Sentences describing expectations about the resolution or possible consequences of any events in the future.

### N/A (N):
- Sentence that's not a part of the news article.
- Like, Slideshow (% images)
- Editing by XYZ
- Visit news.org

## Part II:
- Label a sentence that contains direct quotes or paraphrased speech spoken by a human as 'Speech'.
